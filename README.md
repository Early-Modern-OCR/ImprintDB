# ImprintDB
Printer, Seller, and location information culled from the imprint lines of the entire eMOP dataset. These XML files (EEBO and ECCO separately) contain only those entries for which we have an ESTC number.

# Metadata
Files eMOPDB-TCP-ESTC-01.csv & eMOPDB-TCP-ESTC-02.csv contain this same data in metadata (non-separated imprint info) form. The fields of the CSV are delimited by '|'. The data metadata is broken up into two files of 150+K lines each. (They'll open with OpenOffice or Open Refine.)
